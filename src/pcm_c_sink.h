// pcm_c_sink_t: a PCM sink one native module publishes and another writes to
// from its own task, without the interpreter moving the bytes (usbif#43).
//
// This header is meant to be COPIED. A consumer (earful, say) vendors this
// file rather than including anything else of usbif's, so the two modules
// share a struct layout and nothing more: no link-time dependency, no shared
// MicroPython type. Any publisher can fill the same struct; usbif's UAC host
// output is the first, and audiodsp's audiopump.Ring could be the second.
//
// --- how a consumer gets one -----------------------------------------------
//
// The publisher's Python object has a c_sink() method returning `bytes`: the
// struct itself, by value. The consumer copies it into its own storage with
// pcm_c_sink_copy() below, which also checks it. Nothing
// in the struct points into the MicroPython heap, so the copy never dangles:
// `write` and `space` are functions in firmware, and `ctx` is whatever the
// publisher needs to recognise the stream the sink was issued for (usbif
// passes a generation number, not a pointer).
//
//     mp_obj_t dest[2];
//     mp_load_method_maybe(pcm, MP_QSTR_c_sink, dest);
//     if (dest[0] == MP_OBJ_NULL) { ... no C sink: keep the Python pump ... }
//     mp_obj_t blob = mp_call_method_n_kw(0, 0, dest);       // pcm.c_sink()
//     mp_buffer_info_t info;
//     mp_get_buffer_raise(blob, &info, MP_BUFFER_READ);
//     if (!pcm_c_sink_copy(&self->sink, info.buf, info.len)) {
//         ... not a sink this code understands: keep the Python pump ...
//     }
//
// --- the contract every publisher keeps -------------------------------------
//
// 1. write() and space() may be called from any task or core, including one
//    the interpreter knows nothing about. Neither blocks, allocates, raises,
//    or touches the MicroPython runtime. Both are short: a bounded memcpy.
//
// 2. write() takes up to `len` bytes, in whole frames, and returns how many
//    it took. 0 is normal: the ring is full, or another producer holds it at
//    this instant; come back later. It never waits for room.
//
// 3. Once the publisher's stream is closed, write() and space() return -1,
//    for good. A sink stays closed even if the publisher later opens a new
//    stream: that stream issues a new sink, and the old copy keeps answering
//    -1. A negative return means "stop and forget this sink".
//
// 4. Closing never frees memory a write() is still inside. close() marks the
//    sink closed, then waits for every write() and space() already in
//    progress to return before the ring's storage goes away. A write racing
//    close() on another core therefore does one of two things: it finishes
//    against live storage and its bytes are discarded with the stream, or it
//    returns -1 without touching the ring. It never writes freed memory.
//
// 5. The caller's own obligations: pass whole frames of the published format
//    (`frame_bytes` each), and scale its own samples. Volume on the Python
//    side (audiodev's PCMOutput) is not applied to bytes written here.
//
// One producer at a time is the ring's design. A publisher may let two
// producers race without corrupting the ring (usbif does: the loser gets 0),
// but interleaving two streams of audio is never what anyone wants.
